# /cards Website

This is the website for the /cards (working title) Project. It was initially designed by [Jordan Gardiner](https://github.com/j0rdsta) in Zurb Foundation for Sites v6.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
    + Bower (run `npm install -g bower`)

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `gulp` to run the Sass and Javascript compilers. It will re-run every time you save a Sass or JS file.

**Important:** Be sure to run `gulp --production` before you push to this repository.
